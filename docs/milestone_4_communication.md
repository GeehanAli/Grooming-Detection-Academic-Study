# Milestone 4 — Communicating Results

## 1. Artifact Overview

This milestone produces:
- A public-facing summary (non-technical)
- Visuals: accuracy comparison, confusion matrices, class distribution
- Clear explanation of ML vs keyword behavior

---

## 2. Key Communicated Findings

- ML models capture early-stage signals that keyword lists cannot.
- SVM produced the strongest performance.
- Early grooming cues exist at the behavioral/conversational level.
- Synthetic data is useful for academic prototyping.

---

## 3. Visuals Included

Recommended visuals for final presentation:
- Class distribution chart
- Model accuracy/F1 bar chart
- Confusion matrices
- Flowchart of grooming stages
- Diagram: keyword vs ML signal differences

---

## 4. Narrative Themes

Audience learns:
- Why synthetic data was used
- What the ML models achieved
- What limitations matter most
- How this research contributes to future safety systems

---

## 5. Milestone 4 Summary

Communication materials are now complete and ready for presentation (Milestone 5).
